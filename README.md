# 🚑 MedSync AI
### Real-Time Emergency Room Triage & Hospital Routing with Gemini

**MedSync AI** is an AI-powered emergency response coordination system that helps paramedics and hospitals prioritize critical patients, predict emergency department load, and route patients to the optimal hospital in real time — reducing delays, saving costs, and improving patient outcomes.

> Built as part of **Google Startup School: Prompt to Prototype**  
> Submitted to the **Build the Future Showcase**

## 🚨 The Problem

Emergency departments worldwide face a systemic crisis:

- Up to **40% of ER visits are non-urgent**
- Critical patients experience **dangerous delays**
- Ambulances are routed based on proximity, not readiness
- Hospitals lack real-time visibility into network-wide capacity
- Clinician burnout increases due to mis-triage and overload

Existing systems rely on manual triage or basic symptom checkers and fail to coordinate **patient severity, hospital capacity, specialists, and time sensitivity** together.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**MedSync AI** acts as a **real-time emergency coordination layer**, using Gemini-powered reasoning to assist with:

- Protocol-aligned emergency triage
- Risk-of-deterioration assessment
- Hospital and specialist-aware routing
- Predictive ER load awareness
- Time-critical alerts for cardiac, stroke, and trauma cases

The system is designed as **AI-assisted decision support**, keeping humans in the loop for final medical judgment.

## 🧠 How It Works (GenAI Implementation)

At the core of MedSync AI is a carefully designed **Golden Prompt** implemented in **Google AI Studio**.

The Gemini model:
1. Analyzes patient vitals, symptoms, age, and context  
2. Assigns a triage level inspired by standard emergency protocols  
3. Evaluates hospital capacity, specialist availability, and ETA  
4. Generates explainable, structured recommendations  
5. Flags high-risk cases and safety overrides  

All decision logic is encoded through **prompt engineering**, without custom model training or fine-tuning.

## ✨ What Makes This Unique (Creative Spark)

- **Prompt-as-Logic Architecture**  
  The system instruction itself acts as the core decision engine.

- **Protocol-Aware Prompting**  
  Emergency triage rules and safety constraints are embedded directly into the system prompt.

- **Explainable AI Outputs**  
  Every recommendation includes reasoning and confidence indicators.

- **Disaster-Ready Design**  
  Supports mass-casualty logic focused on resource conservation.

- **Built Entirely with Google AI Studio**  
  Fully aligned with prompt-first, rapid prototyping workflows taught in the program.

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- Chest pain patient routed to a cardiology-capable hospital
- Stroke symptoms flagged with time-critical alerts
- Overloaded ER avoided through predictive routing
- Non-urgent cases safely deprioritized
